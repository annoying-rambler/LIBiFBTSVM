# LIBiFBTSVM

A Python library for an incremental and decremental fuzzy bounded twin support vector machine.

## Description

This library contains the implementation of the increment and decremental fuzzy bounded twin support vector machine [1].

## Installation

In order to be able to use this package, the first step is to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kritchie/LIBiFBTSVM.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository and call the following command (it is recommded to do so in a virtual environment): 

```bash
python setup.py --install
```
